# TOPSIS-with-Python

He was asked to develop a selection tool using the TOPSIS algorithm. The purpose of the TOPSIS algorithm, multiple products, etc. Sorting from the most logical product to the most illogical product according to the criteria. So TOPSIS is a decision-making mechanism.
While doing this research, we realized how important the TOPSIS algorithm actually is. Many companies make profits, reduce losses, look after their business, etc. Apply TOPSIS to choose the right one and act on these results.

This project was carried out with Hatice Damla CALKI. TOPSIS solution is available in our project via Excel. In addition, we completed our project with Python codes on Jupyter Notebook.
